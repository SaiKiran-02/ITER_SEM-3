     matrix. Write a Python program that reads a 3-by-4 matrix and displays the sum of each
     column.

     Here is a sample run:
     Enter a 3-by-4 matrix row by row:
     1.5 2 3 4
     5.5 6 7 8
     9.5 1 3 1
     Sum of the elements at column 0 is 16.5
     Sum of the elements at column 1 is 9.0
     Sum of the elements at column 2 is 13.0
     Sum of the elements at column 3 is 13.0
